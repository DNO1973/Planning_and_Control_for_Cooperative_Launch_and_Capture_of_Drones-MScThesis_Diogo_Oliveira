# MScThesis_Diogo-Oliveira

This repository contains all files regarding the development of my dissertation:
* "cooperative_planning" is the ROS package with all the developed algorithms for the developed system to be integrated into the real hardware and in the ROS+GAZEBO+PX4 simulation environment.
* "mpc_simulation" contains all MATLAB code of interest regarding the preliminary simulations for the cooperative capture scenario. "mpc_simulation_shuttle_and_target.m" represents the main file to run the MATLAB simulations, where "mpc_setup.m" and "mpc_setup_for_gazebo.m" represent the files with the definition of the MPC problem that can be tuned for the MATLAB simulations and the developed ROS-based system, respectively.
* "path_following_simulations" contains SIMULINK simulations for the developed path-following algorithm for the target drone.
